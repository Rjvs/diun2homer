# Diun to Homer

A FastAPI server that receives events from [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) (Docker Image Update Notifier) via the webhook notifier and presents them in a format compatible with [Homer Dashboard](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer). This allows you to see your Docker image update notifications directly in your Homer dashboard.
